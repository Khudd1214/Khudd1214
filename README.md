# Who am I?
Hello! My name is Kenneth Huddleston and I am a professional dedicated to advocating the thoughtful adoption of SRE practices in my organization. I am passionate about using my professional and education background to help my organization drive reliability and performance objectives. I enjoy supporting my development & product teams in building more secure, reliable, and performant software. I am a strong advocate for the use of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and CI/CD practices to drive reliability and performance objectives. I am also passionate about mentoring and supporting my colleagues in their professional development.

## My Role & Vision
### Mission Statement
> I consider it my mission to provide product teams with measurable, transparent, and actionable metrics that can quantitatively define the qualitative aspects of their software. By offering this perspective, I aim to create a partnership with these teams that encourages the delivery of higher quality, more secure features at greater speed.

### Current Role at Trimble
Currently, I serve as an Intermediate Platform Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) at Trimble. As a Platform SRE, I am responsible for driving the reliability and performance objectives across a wide variety of products - while building platform systems and resources that can benefit the rest of the enterprise! In my role, I serve as a Subject Matter Expert (SME) on CI / CD and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) workflows.

### Value to Company Stakeholders
Working for a global software firm, I understand the importance of reliability, security and performance to our customers and stakeholders. In my role, I advocate, design and implement workflows that drive these objectives.

With an emphasis on reliability and efficiency, I provide value to stakeholders by:
- Maximizing system uptime and performance
- Streamlining incident response, reducing Mean Time To Acknowledge (MTTA) and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)
- Developing Release Pipelines (CI / CD), Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and observability workflows that empower development teams to predict and respond to incidents faster.

## My Experience
### Driving Reliability and Performance Objectives for Global Construction Software
I drive reliability and performance objectives for various products in Trimble's global construction software portfolio. Some of the tools and technology I utilize to achieve this are:
- **OpenTelemetry**: As an Open Source 'data tunnel' which drives metrics and logging from our applications to our observability backends.
- **Kubernetes**: For container orchestration and management of microservices.
- **HCP Terraform**: For Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to automate the provisioning and management of cloud resources.
- **GitHub / GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD workflows to automate the software development lifecycle.
- **New Relic**: Our Observability Backend of choice, where I orchestrate data collection, visualization and alerting.
- **PagerDuty**: For incident management, response, and escalation.

### Advocating Improved CI / CD and IaC Practices at HashiConf
In line with business objectives, I have represented Trimble at HashiConf 2023 and 2024. My focus for each conference was to research and discuss scalable production workflows in HCP Terraform. I also received my Terraform Associate certification while attending HashiConf 2023.

### Supporting Leadership Activities through peer training and mentoring
> *"Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn."* <br> Benjamin Franklin

I am passionate about mentoring and supporting my colleagues in their professional development. I am going into my third year of mentoring summer interns in the Platform SRE Team. In my role as a mentor, I support our interns by:

- Clarifying intern objectives, specialties, and learning goals
- Defining high-value project spects for the intern that are appropriate for their learning goals and experience level
- Advocating those project spects to management
- Serving as the primary point architect and QA for the intern's work
- Serving as the intern's primary point of contact for questions and support

## My Achievements

### Performance Ratings
- **Top 5% Engineer**: Rated as a top-performing engineer in my division for the second half of 2024, reflecting my commitment to excellence and innovation.

### Leadership Training
- **Selective Leadership Training**: I was selected for and completed a competitive, year long technical leadership traning program provided by Trimble. This program will conclude with a product demo to Trimble's executive leadership team in August of 2025.

### Promotion Timeline
Although my career in Software is still young, I have a well defined track record of creating value for our stakeholders in fulfilling business objectives. The greatest evidence of this I can provide is my promotion timeline at Trimble:

- **Intern to Entry Level**: I was recruited to Trimble as an intern in summer of 2022. My commitment to quality and personal leadership skills were applauded by my management team, and I was offered a full-time position as a Platform SRE in the fall of 2022.
- **Entry Level to Intermediate**: After just over 2 years of serving with the company, my commitment to improving the quality of my work and job training was recognized. As a direct commendation of my high performance ratings and leadership training, I was promoted to Intermediate Platform SRE in November of 2024.

## My Current Projects
### Defining, Planning and Implementing Quality and Service Objectives for Global ERP Software
In my role at Trimble, I am currently defining Service Level Objectives and Indicators for our latest global ERP software solution. As roadmap planning concludes, I am also slotted to be the primary architect and contributor for implementing these objectives. My goals in this project are to:

- Clearly define standards of software quality (also called Service Level Objectives) across all levels of the tech stack. These include but are not limited to availability, latency, and browser performance.
- Generate meaningful insights on software adherence to Service Level Objectives through effective reporting and data analytics.
- Orchestrate scalable incident response / service management workflows and procedures that facilitate faster Mean Time to Acknowledge (MTTA) and Mean Time to Repair (MTTR).

### AI Chatbot Proof of Concept
As an extracurricular group project, I am in the process of using a ChatGPT 4 based agent with knowledge augmentation to create tailored AI solutions for our engineers. This project is focused on taking publically available inflation / pricing data and augmenting it with internal pricing resources. The end result would be a ChatGPT agent that can provide insight into pricing trends and inflationary pressures on our products. My primary responsibilities in this project are:

- **Data Management**: Researching and identifying data sources that can be used to train the ChatGPT agent. This includes publically available inflation and pricing data, as well as internal pricing resources.
- **CI / CD & Release Procedures**: Utilizing available API resources to automate provisioning, training, and deployment of the ChatGPT agent. The primary mechanism(s) of automation and CI / CD for this project is GitHub actions.

### [Dividend Dollar Investment App](https://github.com/Khudd1214/CS46x---Dividend-Dollars-Investment-App)
As a class project for my Software Engineering degree, I am working on a mobile application called Dividend Dollar. This app is designed to help users track their investments and manage their portfolios. My primary responsibilities in this project are:

- **Project Management**: Leading the project team in defining the scope, objectives, and deliverables of the Dividend Dollar app. This includes creating a project plan, assigning tasks, and ensuring that the project stays on track.
- **CI / CD & Release Procedures**: Utilizing available API resources to automate provisioning, training, and deployment of the Dividend Dollar app. The primary mechanism(s) of automation and CI / CD for this project is Terraform & GitHub actions.
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Designing and implementing the cloud infrastructure for the Dividend Dollar app on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This includes provisioning resources such as databases, storage, and compute instances using Terraform.
